    <LegalShell title="Terms of Service" eyebrow="Legal" updated="April 1, 2026">
      <p>These terms govern your use of The Talus Field (thetalusfieldjournal.com). By using the site, you agree to them.</p>

      <h2>1. Use of content</h2>
      <p>All articles, photographs, and other content on this site are copyrighted by Cory Goehring unless otherwise noted. You may quote up to 300 words in another work with a clear link back to the original article. You may not republish, syndicate, or train machine learning models on any content without written permission.</p>

      <h2>2. Accuracy</h2>
      <p>I try to keep everything on this site accurate, and I update articles when conditions change. That said, conditions in Yosemite change constantly. Trail closures, road closures, weather, wildlife behavior, and permit rules are all subject to change without notice. Always verify current conditions with the National Park Service before any trip.</p>

      <h2>3. No warranty</h2>
      <p>The site is provided as-is. I make no warranty, express or implied, that any information on the site is accurate, complete, or fit for any particular purpose. You assume all risk for your own choices in the park.</p>

      <h2>4. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, The Talus Field is not liable for any injury, loss, or damage arising from your use of this site or your activities in Yosemite National Park. The mountains are real. Walk carefully.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-party links</h2>
      <p>The site contains links to third-party sites, including affiliate links to lodging and gear vendors. We are not responsible for the content or practices of those sites.</p>

      <h2>6. Governing law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California.</p>

      <h2>7. Changes</h2>
      <p>If these terms change in any meaningful way, the change will be announced in the newsletter and the "last updated" date above will change.</p>

    <LegalShell title="Affiliate Disclosure" eyebrow="Legal" updated="April 1, 2026">
      <p>The Talus Field is a participant in several affiliate programs, including Amazon Associates, Bookshop.org, REI's affiliate program, and a small number of guidebook publishers' direct programs.</p>

      <p>What that means in plain language: when an article on this site links to a product, a book, or a piece of lodging, that link may be an affiliate link. If you click through and make a purchase, I receive a small commission. The price you pay does not change. Whether or not you use the affiliate link, the recommendation in the article is the same.</p>

      <h2>What I will and will not do</h2>
      <p>I will only recommend things I have actually used, read, eaten, or stayed in. I will not write a "best XYZ" roundup of products I have never touched. If a piece of gear is on this site, I have walked at least fifty miles in it. If a guidebook is on this site, I have read it cover to cover. If a hotel is on this site, I have either stayed there or know someone who has, and I will tell you which.</p>

      <p>I will not accept payment to recommend something. I have turned down sponsorships from at least four gear companies and one regional tourism board. If that ever changes, I will tell you about it on this page and in the newsletter, on the same day.</p>

      <h2>How to identify an affiliate link</h2>
      <p>Every article that contains affiliate links includes a short note at the end of the article saying so, with a link back to this page. Inline affiliate links are marked with a small icon (★) on hover.</p>

      <h2>FTC disclosure</h2>
      <p>This disclosure is provided in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255, "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."</p>
